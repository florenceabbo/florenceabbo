# 1. Division and Square-root
# Write a function called divide_or_square that takes one argument (a number), and
# returns the square root of the number if it is divisible by 5, returns its remainder if it is
# not divisible by 5. For example, if you pass 10 as an argument, then your function
# should return 3.16 as the square root
# from tkinter import X


# def divide_or_square(num):
#     if num % 5 == 0:
#       square_root = num **0.5
#       print("The square root of the number is:" +str(round(square_root,2)))

#     else:
#         remainder = num % 5
#         print("The rwmainder after dividing by 5 is:" + str( remainder))
# num = int(input("Enter the number here:"))
# divide_or_square(num)

# 2. Strings to Integers
# Write a function called convert_add that takes a list of strings as an argument and
# converts it to integers and sums the list. For example [‘1’, ‘3’, ‘5’] should be
# converted to [1, 3, 5] and summed to 9
# def convert_add(strings):
   
#     sum = 0
#     for x in strings:
#       sum += int(x)
#     print(f"The sum of {strings} is {sum}")
# strings = ["1", "3", "5"]    
# convert_add(strings)
